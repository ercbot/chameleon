# Chameleon: A social deduction game

Chameleon is a social deduction game (Mafia, Among Us, etc.). The game consists of a group of animals (the "herd") who are all the same animal, and the chameleon, who is pretending to be part of the herd. 

Each round, all players say something about themselves, in the form of a "I am a/have/do/etc...." sentence in 10 words or less. All players then vote to try and identify who is the chameleon. For example:

Animal: Owl
Herd player 1: I have sharp claws.
Herd player 2: I am a creature of the night.
Herd player 3: I soar the skies looking for prey.
Herd player 4: I have a keen eye.
Chameleon: I am a predator.

The herd wins if they can successfully determine who is the chameleon. The chameleon wins if they can successfully determine what animal the herd is.

At the start of each game, all players are passed a card containing either the name of an animal, or "chameleon".

There are several variations of the game.

## Chameleon-Judge
In Chameleon-Judge, each game is played as a single round. All players give one description in random order, and then a "judge" player evaluates to determine who is the chameleon. If the judge correctly guesses who the chameleon is, all herd players get one point. If the judge fails to guess correctly, the chameleon gets one point for each member of the herd.

## Chameleon-Secret-Vote
In Chameleon-Vote, each game is played as a single round. All players give one description in random order. All players then, without consulting each other, cast a secret ballot for who is the chameleon. If the majority of players choose the chameleon, the herd wins, and all herd players get one point. Otherwise, the chameleon wins, and the chameleon gets one point for each member of the herd.

## Chameleon-consultation-vote
Same as Chameleon-Vote, but each player can give a statement as to who they think is the chameleon. Players then use this information to cast their vote. 

## Chameleon-multi-round
Each round follows chameleon-consultation-vote. Each player remaining after a round gets one point. Players know who each person voted for the previous round, and know what the previous statements were.
